[{"code":"{ }","question":"# Day 1 - BioNix Workshop\n\nLet's start by defining *computational reproducibility* as always\nobtaining the same output from a computation given the same inputs. In\nother words, computational reproducibility is about making computations\n*deterministic*.  In the research context, this is important as\nreproducibility allows others (and ourselves) to verify and build upon\nwhat we have done in future.\n\n# A functional view of things and why Nix is needed\n\nWhat makes reproducibility difficult is the management of *state*, or\nthe context within with a computation takes place. State manipulation is\nwidespread:  how many apps updates or system updates do you recall\nautomatically being installed over the past year?  Do you think your\nanalysis today will be the same in one years time if your software stack\nhas changed?\n\nOne way to deal with this problem is to make computations *pure* by forbidding\nthe use of anything that is not explicitly stated as an input. This is\nthe same idea of pure functional programming, only at the higher level of\nexecuting software.\n\nNix effectively enforces purity for software execution by ensuring the software\ncannot access anything outside of the specified inputs. By this way, it can\nguarantee a very high degree of reproducibility. Nix is a general build engine\nmost commonly used for building software today, but as we will see a bit later\nit can also execute computational biology workflows in a pure manner with a small\nlibrary called BioNix.\n\n# Nix the language\n\nWe will start with learning Nix the langauge, which is used for\nspecifying workflows. If you are familar with JSON, it is very similar\nin terms of availble data types but has one very important addition:\nfunctions. Let's cover the basic data types and their syntax:\n\n- Strings: `\"this is a string\"`\n\n- can be multiline:\n```\n''\n  This is a multiline\n  indented\n  string\n''\n```\n\n- Numbers: `0`\n\n# About this interface\n\nThis workshop uses [A tour of\nnix](https://github.com/nixcloud/tour_of_nix) with some altered content\nfor the purposes of learning enough of Nix the language to write\nworkflows in BioNix during the second part.
